UMass Amherst CS Women was founded almost 25 years by Prof. Lori Clarke as a community to support and serve women faculty and graduate students. Since its beginnings, the group's vibrant leadership has been spearheaded by graduate women addressing the changing needs of our community.

Today we serve over fifty graduate women. Our membership has expanded to include female undergraduate computer science majors from the five colleges, as well as advocates of any gender who promote the interests of women in computing.

Our focus is on community building. We work closely with the faculty and staff of the School of Computer Science to provide programs and services for our female-identified students. We also organize social events, lectures, and other professional activities that are open to all students in the College of Information and Computer Science.
